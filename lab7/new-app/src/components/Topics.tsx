    <p>Water!</p>

      In a village, there lived a kid who had always said “Water is very important”.
He saved lots of water when he was using it. Many years later, people started
to waste water but the kid didn’t. He tried to tell everyone to take care of
water but they didn’t care.
Then an idea struck him. He showed people responsible ways of saving water
like turning the tap off when brushing teeth. Still the people didn’t care. A
month later, on a cold frosty morning, the people of the village woke up and
discovered that there was no water! They had nothing to drink, to wash and
clean. People were very scared and worried so they approached that kid again.
The kid explained and reminded them that water was so important that
people needed to look after it.
